dev.finances is an web application for manage expenses, like a virtual wallet, developed during the Maratoma Discover promoted by Rocketseat. The app was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 to practice the foundations of frontend development. I've made some improvements from the original project, like adding gradients and implementing the "glass effect", blurring the background of some elements.

## 🔌 Installation

Clone the repository to your machine:

`git clone https://github.com/marmitoTH/devfinances.git`

After cloning the repository, you can run the project using vscode live server extension.
